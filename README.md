Google Play Crawler JAVA API
===================

google-play-crawler is simply for searching android applications on GooglePlay, and also downloading them.

Now you can dowload applications with single click from web to your desktop. 

It also has checkin ability to generate ANDROID-ID for you. 

While doing checkin with your account, it uses Galaxy S3 properties. So only Galaxy S3 compatible applications will be retrieved.
If you try to download incompatible application for Galaxy S3, you will get an exception like this : 
```java
"The item you were attempting to purchase could not be found."
```

Motivated users can add other device properties from here : http://www.glbenchmark.com/phonedetails.jsp?benchmark=glpro25&D=Samsung+GT-I9300+Galaxy+S+III&testgroup=system


This project is available thanks to this project : https://github.com/egirault/googleplay-api. 


Take a look at code, it is not that sophisticated..

## Building and running

Make sure you hava protoc installed.
On OSX:
```
brew install protobuf
```

Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-java
```

Install SBT:
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

To build:
```
sbt assembly
```
Note: This will generate the protobuf java files and compile them as part of the project.


## Usage

### General

### Sub-commands

You can get usage of sub-commands like this :

    java -jar googleplay.jar list --help
    usage: googleplay list [-h] [-s SUBCATEGORY] [-o OFFSET] [-n NUMBER]
                      category

      -o OFFSET, --offset OFFSET
                             offset to define where list begins
      -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
                             how many app will be listed

### About Login & Proxy Arguments

Login & Proxy arguments (androidid, email, password, host, port) can be defined in a configuration file not to pass them every time in command line. 
If you don't want to use proxy, just comment proxy host and port!

    # Login Information
    email = xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com
    password = xxxxxxxxx
    androidid = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    # security token only needed for "usegcm" option
    securitytoken = xxxxxxxx
    
    # Proxy Information
    host=localhost
    port=8888
    
You can use this file like this:

    java -jar googleplay.jar --conf crawler.conf ...

Note that "usegcm" option does not operate on HTTP, so it won't be proxified by this configuration.  
    
### About Account Page Registration

To see your chekined device at your account page(https://play.google.com/store/account), you should register it like this:

    java -jar googleplay.jar -f crawler.conf register

and **download a few application after registration!**(same behaviour of android market application!)

~~Of course this does not allow you to click and download from web page! It is just for information right now!~~

~~But I will see if I can simulate Android GCM(Google Cloud Messaging) push-in mechanism when I have time! So stay tuned.. ;)~~

### About "usegcm" Option

You can use ``usegcm`` option to download applications from web to your desktop like installing to your phone.

All you have to do register your checkined device as described above and execute google-play-crawler like this:

    java -jar googleplay.jar -f crawler.conf usegcm

Now you can login to your account from web browser and try to install any application.


TODO
----
Add other device properties to use with checkin.. (Tablet,.. etc.)

~~Simulate Android GCM Push-in mechanism to allow download from web!~~
